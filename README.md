# game: command-line game manager

The `game` executable is used to run games on Linux from the command line.

I like running things from the command line, so this program is used to launch
games from the command line. It's kind of like if Steam or Lutris were far more
annoying to use. The games are manually configured via a TOML file in the
user's home directory. Native, Wine, DOSBox, and ScummVM games can be launched
via the `game` executable.

## Commands

* `help` - explain all commands
* `list` - list all known games
* `list [TAGS...]` - list all games having a given tag
* `play [GAME_ID]` - play the game with the given ID
* `play-random [TAGS]` - play a random game that matches the given tags
* `tags` - list all tags

Note that tags cannot contain commas because if a comma is used with the list
command, the strings delineated by the tags must _all_ match. Otherwise, any of
the supplied tags must match. For example `doom,mod` would match anything
tagged as _both_ `doom` and `mod` but `doom mod` would match anything tagged
_either_ `doom` _or_ `mod`. To match against the _lack_ of a tag, prefix the
tag with a `!` like `!not_this_tag`.

## Configuration

The configuration file must be in the user's home directory and must be called
`games.toml`. 

### Settings

The `[settings]` table contains global settings.

* `width` (integer) - screen width in pixels (default 1280)
* `height` (integer) - screen height in pixels (default 720)
* `use_gamescope` (boolean) - choose to use `gamescope` or not (default false)

### directories

The `[directories]` table contains directories that can be used to simplify
the creation of many games that all share a common parent directory.

Example:

```toml
[directories]
games_dir = "/home/test/Games"
wine_gog_dir = "/home/test/.wine/drive_c/GOG Games"
```

### games

The `[games]` table holds the actual game configurations. Each game is named
like `[games.GAME_ID]` where `GAME_ID` the the ID you want to use for the game.
Known fields are as follows:

* `cmd` - command to execute to run the game
* `dir` - directory from which to run the game command
* `dosbox_config` - the name of a DOSBox configuration file to use
* `env` - a table where each key/value pair corresponds to an environment
variable that should be set before running the game
* `fps_limit` - set the mangohud FPS limit to given integer
* `installed` - mark a game as installed or not (default is true)
* `prefix_dir` - the key of the entry in the `[directories]` table that is the
parent directory of the `dir`
* `scummvm_id` - the ScummVM target ID of the game to launch
* `tags` - a list of tags (strings) used when listing games
* `use_mangohud` - boolean to control use of mangohud, true by default for wine
* `use_vk` - boolean to control use of dxvk/vkd3d, true by default
* `wine_exe` - the name of the Windows executable for `wine` to execute

_Technically_ all of these fields are optional, but at least one of `cmd`,
`wine_exe`, `dosbox_config`, or `scummvm_id` is required.

## External Dependencies

This program assumes that you have the following programs installed:

* Wine
* Mangohud
* DOSBox
